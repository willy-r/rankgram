# Rankgram

**Rankgram** is a simple bookmarklet that ranks Instagram post comments by user and number of unique comments. It helps you generate a TXT ranking list of the users who commented the most on any Instagram post, making it ideal for social engagement campaigns, contests, or giveaways.

## Getting Started (Run Locally)

If you want to build, customize, or improve this tool locally, follow these steps:

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/willy-r/rankgram.git
cd rankgram
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

You only need Node.js (for building) and `uglify-js` (for minification):

```bash
npm install -g uglify-js
```

### 3. **Build the Project**

Run the provided shell script to minify the bookmarklet and generate the HTML:

```bash
bash minifier.sh
```

This will:

* Minify `rank-comments.js` into `rank-comments.min.js`
* Generate `index.html` with the bookmarklet embedded

### 4. **Open the App**

Open `index.html` in your browser to use the tool or to test any style/UI changes.

1. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
2. **Drag the `[üìä rankgram 1.0.0]` button** to your bookmarks bar.
3. **Go to any Instagram post** (while logged in).
4. **Click the bookmarklet** and wait while it collects comments (progress shown).
